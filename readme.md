## Training and Evaluating Instructions
### Requirements

- **Python**: 3.12
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04 recommended (for Windows, use Docker)

### Setup Instructions

1. Create and activate a Conda environment:
```
conda create --name drama python=3.12
conda activate drama
```
2. Note that because `mamba-ssm` in _requirements.txt_ requires `pytorch`, so one should install `pytorch` before _requirements.txt_.
```
pip install torch==2.7.0 torchvision==0.22.0 torchaudio==2.7.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
```

3. Install `mamba-ssm` manually:
```
# Install build tools for mamba-ssm
pip install ninja packaging "setuptools>=70.0.0,<76.0.0"

# This is required BEFORE mamba-ssm
pip install causal-conv1d>=1.4.0 --no-build-isolation

# Use --no-build-isolation to avoid torch version conflicts
pip install mamba-ssm==2.2.6.post3 --no-build-isolation
```

4. Now install the rest of the requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Docker Instructions
---

1. Build the Docker image
```
docker build -f Dockerfile -t drama .
```
2. Run the container with GPU support
```
docker run --gpus all -it --rm drama
```
_Note: Running via Docker may result in slower performance. Please refer [here](https://forums.docker.com/t/docker-extremely-slow-on-linux-and-windows/129752), it is recommended to reproduce the result in ubuntu OS._

### Training Instructions
---
Train with the default hyperparameters (the configuration files can be found in `config_files/train.yaml`)
```
python train.py
```
If one wants to change the hyperparmeter there are two ways:

1. Edit the configuration file `config_files/train.yaml`.
2. Run the `train.py` with parameters that corresponding to `config_files/train.yaml`. e.g.,`python train.py --Models.WorldModel.Backbone Mamba`.

### Important parameters:
Drama supports three different dynamic models: _Transformer_, _Mamba_ and _Mamba-2_. It supports two type of behaviour models: _Actor-critic_ and _PPO_.
